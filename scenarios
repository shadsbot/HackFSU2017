[O3]You wake up in a
[O3]You awaken in a
[O3]Opening your eyes, you see you are in a
[O0]You're not quite sure where you are. Everything is black. You reach an arm out in front of you, feeling the void in disbelief. You are taken aback when your arm doesn't appear. It's pitch black.
[O1]Are you awake or is this a dream? You can hardly see anything in front of you. You're not quite sure where you are.
[00]It's dark. You can't even see your hand in front of your face.
[D3]Puddles are pooling on the ground, and you can see water slowly dripping from the ceiling above. The floor is visibly discoloured, a mossy shade of green staining the rock.
[D2]You accidentally step in a puddle. The water soaks through a small hole in your boot that you didn't even know was there. Your socks are wet, and your day ruined.
[D1]You can tell you're in a damp room. Moreso by the sound of dripping water than anything else. You can't really see much.
[D1]You feel a water droplet fall on your head. You wish you could have seen that coming.
[D2]Patches of the room are submersed in water. You wonder why its eroding the way it is.
[D3]The ceiling is leaking. You must be under a stream or a large body of water. No sense in going up. Not that you could, anyway.
[D0]Damp and Dark, the perfect combination.
[R3]There's a nice rocky formation on the walls. You might stop to admire the natural formations, if you had time.
[R4]God Himself has blinded you, it is so bright.
[R3]There are some branches protruding from the ceiling. Maybe they're roots of some kind. They look like they could hold your weight, but you'd rather not try it.
[R3]You may not know much about caves, but you take a guess that they're not supposed to suddenly become bleached white. The roots here are dead.
[R3]There's a break in the ceiling and you can see sunlight shining in. It's too far to reach. You shout to see if anyone is nearby, but there is no response.
[R2]Squinting, you swear you see someone in the shadows move away. Huh?
[R2]The rocky formation is casting all sorts of weird shadows. You can't really make out much.
[R2]Your stomach growls, you wish you had some trail mix or something. It's hard to see, and straining your eyes you see... Oh my god... More rock.
[R1]Something brushes up against you, you pray that it is the walls. You shift your weight and it's gone. You can't see anything.
[R1]You really wish you had a torch. You can't see anything.
[R1]In an act of desperation, you outstretch your arms. You find a wall and manage to orient yourself. You can't see anything.
[R1]Clinging to the walls, you try to get a bearing on the room you're in.
